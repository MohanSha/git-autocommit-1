git-autocommit
==============

Automatically commits each change in a git repository.


Usage
-----

To use copy ``git-autocommit`` to some directory in your ``$PATH`` and run
``git autocommit`` in the root of the git repository. It also automatically
adds files to the repository, so you should list everything you don't want
added in ``.gitignore``.

It requires Python 3 and ``pyinotify``.
